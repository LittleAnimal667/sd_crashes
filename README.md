# sd_crashes

In this project I am looking for an increase in collisions, assuming there will be a significant amount more post pandemic. My theory is that brain fog is such a significant side effect of Covid-19 infection that it would affect all things that require focus, driving in this case. 

Data used in this project is from the police collisions reports, and  traffic census, both from data.sandiego.gov.

Using Pandas in Jupyter notebook to clean the data, looking specifically at injuries and mortality after collision, and Matplotlib to get an idea of how the data looks. Afterwards I move the project to Tableau in order to beautify and more intuitively look at the data.
